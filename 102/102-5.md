CSS, short for Cascading Style Sheets, is a style sheet language used for describing the look and formatting of a document written in HTML or XML. The purpose of CSS is to enable the separation of presentation and content, including layout, colors, and fonts. This separation improves content accessibility, provides more flexibility and control in the specification of presentation characteristics, enables multiple web pages to share formatting, and reduces complexity and repetition in the structural content.

There are three ways to insert CSS into your project:

1. **Inline CSS**: With this method, you can directly apply the CSS to the HTML elements using the 'style' attribute inside the HTML tag. However, it's not the best practice as it leads to a lot of repetition and a lack of separation between style and content.

2. **Internal CSS (or Embedded CSS)**: In this method, you include the CSS in the `<head>` section of your HTML file within `<style>` tags. This is used when a single HTML document must be styled uniquely.

3. **External CSS**: In this method, you write CSS rules in a separate .css file and then link that file in your HTML document using a `<link>` element in the `<head>` section. This is the most common method used for large websites as it allows for better organization, reuse of CSS rules across multiple pages, and easier maintenance.

Here's an example of a CSS rule that would give all `<p>` elements red text:

```css
p {
    color: red;
}
```

This rule selects all paragraph (`<p>`) elements and applies the style `color: red;` to them, which makes their text color red.
